# covid19-dataset-visualization
Installing the dataset- "pip install covid"
It is a Python package to get information regarding the novel corona virus provided by Johns Hopkins university and worldometers.info.

Requirements- python >= 3.6

I have used several visualizaton packages, libraries like seaborn, matplotlib. I have plotted different plots like boxplot, scatter plot, stackplot, displot and also showed different graphs, piecharts to explain the variations in active, recovered and death cases.

I have done the above course project during my course-work "Advanced Programming in Python(DSE309)" while studying at Indian Institute of Science Educatioon and Research(IISER) Bhopal in the 3rd year of my BS in Data Science.
